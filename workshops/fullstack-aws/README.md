# Full-Stack on AWS: Free Bootcamp Curriculum

> Build and ship a production-ready full-stack app on AWS: React + FastAPI + MongoDB + Terraform + GitHub Actions + AI coding tools.

**⭐ Star and fork this repo.** It's the reference you'll keep coming back to after the bootcamp.

## What You'll Build

A deployable, portfolio-ready full-stack app on AWS, built with AI-assisted coding:

| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React |
| Backend | FastAPI (Python) |
| Database | MongoDB |
| Auth | JWT |
| Infrastructure | Terraform on AWS |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |
| AI Tools | Cursor, Claude, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot |

## Projects

| Project | Stack | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [01: Task Tracker](./projects/01-task-tracker/) | React + Lambda + MongoDB | Kanban-style task board, full-stack capstone |
| [02: Notice Board](./projects/02-notice-board/) | React + S3 + Lambda | Assignment with 3 difficulty tiers |
| [03: URL Bookmark Saver](./projects/03-url-bookmark-saver/) | React + Lambda + DynamoDB | Serverless bookmark app with CI/CD pipeline |
| [04: Architecture Diagram](./projects/04-architecture-diagram/) | React + S3 + CloudFront | Static SPA deployed via Terraform |

Each project has working Terraform, a deploy script, and a GitHub Actions pipeline. Deploy to your own AWS account in under 30 minutes.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/becloudready/workshops.git
cd workshops/fullstack-aws
```

Prerequisites: AWS account (free tier works), AWS CLI, Terraform, Node.js 18+, Python 3.10+, Git.

Start at [Chapter 01](./chapters/01-vibe-coding/).

## Who This Is For

- Fresh graduates preparing for a first engineering role
- Developers stuck at tutorial level who haven't shipped a real deployed app
- Anyone using AI coding tools (Cursor, Claude, Copilot) who needs the engineering fundamentals employers expect
- Job seekers who want a portfolio project that runs in production, not localhost

---

## Resource Naming (recommended, not IAM-enforced)

Prefix every resource with:

```
student-<your-slug>-
```

Your slug is assigned by the cohort admin (e.g. `alice-johnson`). This isn't blocked by IAM, it's just good hygiene so you and the instructor can tell resources apart in a shared account.

## Resource Tagging (required, read before you start)

Tag every resource you create:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `workshop` | `full-stack` |
| `autodelete` | `true` or `false` |
| `date` | `dd-mmm-yyyy`, e.g. `12-Jul-2026` |

**This is the part that's actually enforced.** A nightly script deletes anything without these tags, no warning. `autodelete=true` means it's also safe for the instructor's end-of-batch cleanup to remove it. Use `autodelete=false` only for something you were explicitly told to keep.

Terraform projects handle this automatically when you pass `student_name=<slug>` and `created_date=<dd-mmm-yyyy>`.

## Live Delivery

This curriculum is delivered as an instructor-led workshop by [beCloudReady](https://becloudready.com).

- **Format:** 1-week intensive, live sessions + async lab time
- **Stack:** per-student AWS sandbox with GitHub Copilot seats included
- **Outcome:** deployed portfolio project + CI/CD pipeline in production

## Sandbox Setup (Instructor / Admin)

The [`terraform-iam/`](./terraform-iam/) folder provisions per-student AWS sandboxes for live cohorts: IAM users, namespace-scoped managed policies, Terraform workspaces per batch.

See [`admin-walkthrough.md`](./admin-walkthrough.md) for the full cohort setup process.
