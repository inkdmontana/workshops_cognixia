# Redshift Serverless: Student Labs

Welcome! In these labs you will connect Amazon Redshift Serverless to live and
external data, then query it across sources.

  Lab 1: Query S3 data files using Redshift Spectrum
  Lab 2: Query a live Aurora PostgreSQL database (Federated Query)
  Lab 3: Cross-source join: S3 sales + Aurora customers in one query
  Lab 4: Auto-discover schema with Glue Crawler, then query from Redshift

Everyone shares the same Redshift workgroup. You keep your work separate by
putting your student number in every name you create.

---

You have been assigned a number, e.g. 01, 02, 03 ...

Everywhere you see **NN** in this handout, replace it with YOUR number.

Example: if you are student 04, then

| Placeholder | Your value |
|---|---|
| `ext_pg_studentNN` | `ext_pg_student04` |
| `ext_s3_studentNN` | `ext_s3_student04` |
| `ext_oil_studentNN` | `ext_oil_student04` |
| `spectrum_db_studentNN` | `spectrum_db_student04` |
| `spectrum_oil_studentNN` | `spectrum_oil_student04` |
| `quicklabs-studentNN-curated` | `quicklabs-student04-curated` |

**IMPORTANT:** Use YOUR number consistently. If two students use the same name,
your tables will clash. The instructor uses NN = 00 for the demo.

---

## Connecting to the Query Editor (read this first)

1. Open **Amazon Redshift → Query editor v2** in the AWS Console.
2. In the left panel, click the shared workgroup your instructor points you to.
3. A connection dialog appears. Select **Federated user**: no password needed.
   Make sure **Database** shows `dev`, then click **Create connection**.

   ![Connect to workgroup dialog](https://pub-5c24f672454946bb951bf35f09c3964e.r2.dev/learn/aws-data-engineer/redshift-serverless/01-01-rs-connect-workgroup.png)

4. Confirm the database at the top is `dev`.

You will see two types of entries in the left catalog tree:

- **Native databases**: schemas you create live here, under `dev`
- **External databases**: the shared AWS Glue Data Catalog

![Workgroup catalog: collapsed view](https://pub-5c24f672454946bb951bf35f09c3964e.r2.dev/learn/aws-data-engineer/redshift-serverless/01-02-rs-catalog-layout.png)

You will see databases that OTHER students created (like `spectrum_db_student02`).
This is normal: the Glue catalog is account-wide. Use YOUR own names and ignore
the rest.

## LAB 1: Query S3 Data with Redshift Spectrum

**Goal:** Create external tables over Parquet files in S3 and query them like
normal tables: without loading anything into Redshift.

You will use the TICKIT sample sales data already placed in S3 at:
`s3://quicklabs-raw-data/tickit/spectrum/sales/`

Your instructor will give you:

```
ROLE_ARN =
```

---

**Step 1: Create your external schema**

Replace NN with your number. `spectrum_db_studentNN` must be unique to you.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL SCHEMA ext_s3_studentNN
FROM DATA CATALOG
DATABASE 'spectrum_db_studentNN'
REGION 'us-west-2'
IAM_ROLE 'ROLE_ARN'
CREATE EXTERNAL DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS;
```

`CREATE EXTERNAL DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS` creates your own Glue database named
`spectrum_db_studentNN` automatically.

---

**Step 2: Create the SALES external table**

The data is TAB-separated. Replace NN with your number.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ext_s3_studentNN.sales (
    salesid     INTEGER,
    listid      INTEGER,
    sellerid    INTEGER,
    buyerid     INTEGER,
    eventid     INTEGER,
    dateid      SMALLINT,
    qtysold     SMALLINT,
    pricepaid   DECIMAL(8,2),
    commission  DECIMAL(8,2),
    saletime    TIMESTAMP
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'
STORED AS TEXTFILE
LOCATION 's3://quicklabs-raw-data/tickit/spectrum/sales/'
TABLE PROPERTIES ('numRows'='172000');
```

---

**Step 3: Query your S3 data**

```sql
SELECT * FROM ext_s3_studentNN.sales LIMIT 10;
```

---

**Step 4: Run an aggregate query**

```sql
SELECT eventid, SUM(pricepaid) AS total_sales
FROM ext_s3_studentNN.sales
WHERE pricepaid > 30
GROUP BY eventid
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Check your work:** the top three `eventid` values should be 289, 7895, and 1602.

---

**Step 5 (bonus): See which S3 file each row came from**

```sql
SELECT "$path", salesid, pricepaid
FROM ext_s3_studentNN.sales
LIMIT 5;
```

The `$path` column shows the exact S3 object behind each row.

---

## LAB 2: Federated Query to Aurora PostgreSQL

**Goal:** Run SQL in Redshift that reads a live Aurora PostgreSQL table directly:
no data copying, no ETL.

Your instructor will give you:

```
AURORA_ENDPOINT =
ROLE_ARN        =
SECRET_ARN      =
```

---

**Step 1: Create your federated external schema**

Replace NN with your number and fill in the three values above.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL SCHEMA ext_pg_studentNN
FROM POSTGRES
DATABASE 'postgres'
SCHEMA 'public'
URI 'AURORA_ENDPOINT'
PORT 5432
IAM_ROLE 'ROLE_ARN'
SECRET_ARN 'SECRET_ARN';
```

---

**Step 2: Query the live Aurora data**

```sql
SELECT * FROM ext_pg_studentNN.customers LIMIT 10;
```

These rows live in Aurora, not in Redshift. You are reading them live.

---

**Step 3: Run a real aggregate query**

```sql
SELECT region, COUNT(*) AS num_customers
FROM ext_pg_studentNN.customers
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY num_customers DESC;
```

---

## LAB 3: Cross-Source Join: S3 + Aurora in One Query

**Goal:** Write a single SQL query that joins S3 sales data (Spectrum) with live
Aurora customer data (federated query): two sources, one result set.

**Prerequisite:** Labs 1 and 2 must be complete and your schemas must exist.

---

**Query 1: Revenue by customer region**

```sql
SELECT
    c.region,
    COUNT(DISTINCT s.salesid)  AS num_sales,
    SUM(s.pricepaid)           AS total_revenue
FROM ext_s3_studentNN.sales      AS s
JOIN ext_pg_studentNN.customers  AS c
    ON s.buyerid = c.id
GROUP BY c.region
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

Redshift reads S3 locally via Spectrum and pushes the join predicate down to
Aurora via federated query: no data lands in Redshift.

---

**Query 2: Verify both sources are live**

```sql
SELECT 'from S3'     AS source, COUNT(*) FROM ext_s3_studentNN.sales
UNION ALL
SELECT 'from Aurora' AS source, COUNT(*) FROM ext_pg_studentNN.customers;
```

---

## LAB 4: Auto-Discover Schema with Glue Crawler, Query from Redshift

**Goal:** Use a Glue Crawler to automatically detect the schema of your curated
oil Parquet data (created in Lab 1 / Glue ETL), register it in the Glue Data
Catalog, and query it from Redshift Spectrum: without writing any DDL yourself.

**Why this matters:** In Lab 1 you hand-wrote the `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE`
statement. In production, tables change and schemas evolve. A Glue Crawler
detects the schema automatically and keeps it current.

**Prerequisite:** Lab 1 (Glue ETL) must be complete. Your curated Parquet files
must exist at `s3://quicklabs-studentNN-curated/oil_curated/`.

---

**Step 1: Create a Glue Crawler**

1. Open **AWS Glue → Crawlers** in the Console.
2. Click **Create crawler**.
3. Fill in the details:

   | Field | Value |
   |---|---|
   | Crawler name | `quicklabs-studentNN-oil-crawler` |
   | Data source type | S3 |
   | S3 path | `s3://quicklabs-studentNN-curated/oil_curated/` |
   | IAM role | Select the pre-provisioned Glue role your instructor provided |
   | Target database | Click **Add database** → name it `spectrum_oil_studentNN` |
   | Table name prefix | Leave empty |
   | Crawler schedule | On demand |

4. Review and click **Create crawler**.

---

**Step 2: Run the crawler**

1. Select your crawler `quicklabs-studentNN-oil-crawler`.
2. Click **Run**.
3. Wait for the **Status** to change from `Running` to `Ready` (usually 1–2 minutes).

---

**Step 3: Inspect what the crawler discovered**

1. Go to **AWS Glue → Databases → `spectrum_oil_studentNN`**.
2. Click **Tables**: you should see a table named `oil_curated` (or similar,
   based on the S3 folder name).
3. Click the table name and review:
   - **Schema**: columns and types detected automatically from Parquet
   - **Location**: the S3 prefix the table points to
   - **Classification**: should show `parquet`

   Note the exact table name: you will use it in Step 5.

---

**Step 4: Create an external schema in Redshift pointing to your Glue database**

Back in **Redshift Query Editor v2**, run:

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL SCHEMA ext_oil_studentNN
FROM DATA CATALOG
DATABASE 'spectrum_oil_studentNN'
IAM_ROLE 'ROLE_ARN'
REGION 'us-west-2';
```

Use the same `ROLE_ARN` as Labs 1 and 2.

---

**Step 5: Query your crawler-discovered table**

Replace `oil_curated` with the exact table name the crawler created if different.

```sql
SELECT * FROM ext_oil_studentNN.oil_curated LIMIT 10;
```

You should see crude oil price rows: the same data you transformed with your
Glue ETL job, now queryable from Redshift without any DDL.

---

**Step 6: Run analytics queries**

Average closing price by year:

```sql
SELECT
    year,
    ROUND(AVG(close), 4) AS avg_close,
    ROUND(MIN(close), 4) AS min_close,
    ROUND(MAX(close), 4) AS max_close,
    COUNT(*)             AS trading_days
FROM ext_oil_studentNN.oil_curated
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year;
```

Highest-volume months:

```sql
SELECT
    year,
    month,
    SUM(volume)          AS total_volume,
    ROUND(AVG(close), 4) AS avg_close
FROM ext_oil_studentNN.oil_curated
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY total_volume DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

**Step 7 (bonus): Confirm the crawler table and your manual table agree**

In Lab 1 you created `ext_s3_studentNN.sales` by hand. In this lab, the crawler
built the table definition for you. Confirm both paths return the same row count:

```sql
-- Crawler-discovered table (oil data)
SELECT 'crawler-discovered' AS method, COUNT(*) AS rows
FROM ext_oil_studentNN.oil_curated

UNION ALL

-- Hand-written DDL (sales data from Lab 1)
SELECT 'manual DDL' AS method, COUNT(*) AS rows
FROM ext_s3_studentNN.sales;
```

Both rows should return counts. The point: the crawler saved you from writing
the Parquet column definitions yourself: it read them from the file metadata.

---

## Troubleshooting

| What you see | What to do |
|---|---|
| "schema … already exists" | Someone (maybe you) used that name. Use your own NN. |
| "authentication method 10 not supported" | Tell instructor: Aurora user needs md5 password encoding |
| Glue / CreateDatabase not authorized | Tell instructor: IAM role not attached to Redshift namespace |
| S3 access denied / 0 rows from Spectrum | Check the LOCATION path ends with `/` and matches your bucket exactly |
| "relation does not exist" | Wrong schema name: check your NN matches what you created |
| Crawler status stays "Running" > 5 min | Check the S3 path is correct and the IAM role has S3 read access |
| Crawler creates 0 tables | The S3 path is empty: confirm Lab 1 Glue ETL ran successfully first |
| External schema already exists after crawler | Drop it: `DROP SCHEMA ext_oil_studentNN` then re-run Step 4 |

To reset any lab, drop your schema:

```sql
DROP SCHEMA ext_s3_studentNN;
DROP SCHEMA ext_pg_studentNN;
DROP SCHEMA ext_oil_studentNN;
```

## What you learned

- **Spectrum:** Redshift queries Parquet/CSV files in S3 as external tables: no data movement.
- **Federated query:** Redshift reads a live PostgreSQL (Aurora) database in real time: no copy.
- **Cross-source join:** A single SQL statement can join data from S3 and a live RDS database simultaneously.
- **Glue Crawler:** Automatically detects schema from S3 files and registers tables in the Glue Data Catalog: eliminates hand-written DDL and keeps schemas current as data evolves.
- **External schemas** are your namespace in Redshift; the Glue databases behind them are account-wide: that's why you see everyone's in the catalog.
- One Redshift workgroup serves many users: isolation comes from consistent naming with your own NN.
